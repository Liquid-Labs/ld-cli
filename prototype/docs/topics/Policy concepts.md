We adopt the standard compliance/regulatory lexicon, wherein:

* *Policies* defines goals.
   * A policy document consists of a series of discrete statements.
   * Policy statements are essentially aspirational; e.g., "The Company will adopt standards and procedures to better ensure a diverse workforce."
* *Standards* define how we measure achievement of the goals specified in the policies.
   * A standards document consists of a series of discrete statements.
   * Standard statements specify concrete, quantifiable measurements; e.g., "For each target Demographic Category, the Company workforce percentages should reflect the percentages found in Geographic Hiring Region within 5 percentage points (absolute)."
   * In many instances, the "measurement" is a simple true false. I.e., "On all resumes, a method or tool will be employed to remove simple gender and ethnic markers (such as candidate's name and pronouns) and replace any educational summary with a gender and ethnic neutral description."
   * In the above example, the Company would then maintain a "Demographic Categories" table naming the demographics tracked by the Company for diversity purposes; e.g., male, female, gender non-binary, White, Black, Mexican, South-American, Native American, etc., define the "Geographic Hiring Region", and then compare the Company demographics against that of the region. If each Company demographic bucket is within +/-5% of the region, then the Company is in compliance with the standard.
* *Procedures* are step by step instructions on how to execute specific tasks such that they are compliant with all Company standards.
   * A procedure document consists of step-by-step instructions and explanatory comments.
   * The instructions provide concrete direction and are directed at achieving consistent results. E.g., "When posting the job description, ensure that the 'Mask gender and ethnicity" option."
* *Guidelines* are essentially descriptive text that provides additional explanation, examples, and/or context around other pieces of the Policy.
   * Guidelines are essentially prose documents organized into sections.
   * Guidelines may be incorporated into and alongside procedures.
